=== {elastic-integration-name} filter plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

Using this filter you can process Elastic integrations in Logstash.

.Technology Preview
****
This {elastic-integration-name} filter plugin is part of a _Technology Preview_, which means that both configuration options and implementation details are subject to change in minor releases without being preceded by deprecation warnings.

Before upgrading this plugin or Logstash itself, please pay special attention to the changelogs to avoid being caught by surprise.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-security"]
==== Security

SSL is enabled by default in the plugin.

At a minimum, in order to establish secured SSL connection, you will need to either configure the plugin to trust to the server it is connecting to, or present its own identity.
You can also disable SSL which is not recommended.

===== SSL Identity

As an SSL identity, this plugin will need to present the SSL certificate that the server trusts and have access to the associated key.
These are configurable with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate>>, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key>>, and <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key_passphrase>>.

===== SSL Server Authentication

When connection to a server, the trust criteria can be proceeded based on <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode>>.
For example, if `certificate` mode, the plugin validates the dates of server certificate as well as it verifies the CA that issued server certificate is legitimate and trustworthy based on <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate_authorities>>.
Refer to <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode>> explanation section for more information.


===== HTTP Basic Authentication

You can use HTTP Basic authentication by configuring <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_username>> and <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_password>>.

NOTE: Basic Authentication is not a substitute for SSL, as it provides neither secrecy nor security on its own.
When used with SSL disabled, HTTP Basic credentials are transmitted in effectively clear-text and can be easily recovered by an adversary.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-hosts"]
===== `hosts`

* Value type is <<array,array>>
* There is no default value for this setting.

A list of Elasticsearch hosts to connect.

Examples:

    `"127.0.0.1"`
    `["127.0.0.1:9200","127.0.0.2:9200"]`
    `["http://127.0.0.1"]`
    `["https://127.0.0.1:9200"]`
    `["https://127.0.0.1:9200/subpath"]` (If using a proxy on a subpath)

Set HTTPS to each entry when using SSL or HTTP when not using.
When port is not specified, the plugin uses default 9200. Similarly, it uses default `/` path.

Any special characters present in the URLs here MUST be URL escaped! This means
`#` should be put in as `%23` for instance.


[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-cloud_id"]
===== `cloud_id`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting.

Cloud ID, from the Elastic Cloud web console.
This setting should not be used when `hosts` are specified.

For more details, check out the
{logstash-ref}/connecting-to-cloud.html[Logstash-to-Cloud documentation].

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl"]
===== `ssl`

* Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
* Default value is `true`.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode"]
===== `ssl_verification_mode`

* Value type is <<array,array>>
* Default value is `full`.

Type of verification.

* Available modes:
** `certificate`: validates the specified certificate that it is signed by provided Certificate Authority (CA).
** `full`: validates `certificate` mode, and IP address that matches the ones certificate carries.
** `none`: verification process will not be proceeded.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-truststore"]
===== `truststore`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
