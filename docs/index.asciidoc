=== {elastic-integration-name} filter plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

.Elastic Enterprise License
****
Use of this plugin requires an active Enterprise Elastic License.
****

==== Description

Using this filter you can process Elastic integrations powered by {es} Ingest Node in Logstash.

Once configured to point to an {es} cluster, events processed by this filter will first resolve their effective data-stream, and determine from {es} which ingest pipeline to run.
The ingest pipeline will be run inside Logstash without transmitting the event to {es}.
Events that are successfully handled by their ingest pipeline will have `[@metadata][target_ingest_pipeline]` set to `+_none+` so that any downstream {es} output in the Logstash pipeline will avoid running the event's default pipeline _again_ in {es}.

NOTE: Some multi-pipeline configurations such as logstash-to-logstash over http(s) do not maintain the state of `[@metadata]` fields.
      In these setups, you may need to explicitly configure your downstream pipeline's {es} output with `+pipeline => "_none"+` to avoid re-running the default pipeline.

Events that _fail_ ingest pipeline processing will be tagged with `_ingest_pipeline_failure`, and their `[@metadata][_ingest_pipeline_failure]` will be populated with details as a key/value map.

IMPORTANT: This plugin requires minimum Java 17 and Logstash 8.7.0 versions.

.Technology Preview
****
This {elastic-integration-name} filter plugin is part of a _Technology Preview_, which means that both configuration options and implementation details are subject to change in minor releases without being preceded by deprecation warnings.

Before upgrading this plugin or Logstash itself, please pay special attention to the changelogs to avoid being caught by surprise.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-minimum_configuration"]
==== Minimum Configuration

You will need to configure this plugin to connect to {es}, and may need to also need to provide local GeoIp databases.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-connecting_to_elasticsearch"]
==== Connecting to {es}

This plugin communicates with {es} to identify which ingest pipeline should be run for a given event, and to retrieve the ingest pipeline definitions themselves.
You must configure this plugin to point to {es} using exactly one of:

* A Cloud Id (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-cloud_id>>)
* A list of one or more host URLs (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-hosts>>)

Communication will be made securely over SSL unless you explicitly configure this plugin otherwise.

You may need to configure how this plugin establishes trust of the server that responds,
and will likely need to configure how this plugin presents its own identity or credentials.

===== SSL Trust Configuration

When communicating over SSL, this plugin fully-validates the proof-of-identity presented by {es} using the system trust store.
You can provide an _alternate_ source of trust with one of:

* A PEM-formatted list of trusted certificate authorities (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate_authorities>>)
* A JKS- or PKCS12-formatted Keystore containing trusted certificates (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path>>)

You can also configure which aspects of the proof-of-identity are verified (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode>>).

===== SSL Identity Configuration

When communicating over SSL, you can also configure this plugin to present a certificate-based proof-of-identity to the {es} cluster it connects to using one of:

* A PKCS8 Certificate/Key pair (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate>>)
* A JKS- or PKCS12-formatted Keystore (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_keystore_path>>)

===== Request Identity

You can configure this plugin to present authentication credentials to {es} in one of several ways:

* ApiKey: (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-api_key>>)
* Cloud Auth: (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-cloud_auth>>)
* HTTP Basic Auth: (see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_username>> and <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_password>>)

NOTE: Your request credentials are only as secure as the connection they are being passed over.
      They provide neither privacy nor secrecy on their own, and can easily be recovered by an adversary when SSL is disabled.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-supported_ingest_processors"]
==== Supported Ingest Processors

This filter can run {es} Ingest Node pipelines that are _wholly_ comprised of the supported subset of processors.
It has access to the Painless and Mustache scripting engines where applicable:

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-field_mappings"]
===== Field Mappings

During execution, the Ingest pipeline works with a temporary mutable _view_ of the Logstash event that re-shapes some {ls}-reserved fields into their expected IngestDocument field names and object-types.
Changes to the IngestDocument will be reflected in the resulting Logstash Event, including safely mapping these reserved fields _back_ from the IngestDocument reserved field to the {ls} reserved field counterpart.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|=======================================================================

| {ls} Field | IngestDocument Field | Conflict Handling

| `@timestamp` | `_ingest.timestamp` |when ingest processing _also_ sets a top-level `@timestamp` field, it will be made available via the Event's `_@timestamp` field

| `@version` | `_version` | when ingest processing _also_ sets a top-level `@version` field in the source, it will be made available via the Event's `_@version` field

| `@metadata` | `@metadata` | when ingest processing replaces the top-level `@metadata` map with an object that is not a string-object map, it will be made available via the Event's `_@metadata` field.

| `tags` | `tags` | when ingest processing produces a top-level `tags` field that is not a collection of strings, it will be made available via the event's `_tags` field.

| _everything else_ | _in-place, as-structured_ | only minimal type conversions are done
|=======================================================================

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-resolving"]
==== Resolving Pipeline Definitions

:cached-entry-ttl: 24 hours
:cache-reload-frequency: 1 minute

This plugin uses {es} to establish mappings of datastream names to pipeline names, and also to resolve pipeline names into their pipeline definitions.
It uses hit/miss caches to avoid querying Elasticsearch for every single event.
It also works to update these cached mappings _before_ they expire.
The result is that when {es} is responsive this plugin is able to pick up changes quickly without impacting its own performance, and it can survive periods of {es} issues without interruption by continuing to use potentially-stale mappings or definitions.

To achieve this, mappings are cached for a maximum of {cached-entry-ttl}, and cached values are reloaded every {cache-reload-frequency} with the following effect:

* when a reloaded mapping is non-empty and is the _same_ as its already-cached value, we reset its time-to-live to ensure that subsequent events can continue using the confirmed-unchanged value
* when a reloaded mapping is non-empty and is _different_ from its previously-cached value, we _update_ the entry so that subsequent events will use the new value
* when a reloaded mapping is newly _empty_, we _replace_ the previous non-empty mapping with a new empty entry so that subsequent events will use the empty value
* when we _fail_ to reload a mapping, this plugin emits a log warning but the existing cache entry is unchanged and gets closer to its expiry.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-options"]

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_password"]
===== `auth_basic_password`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Required when request auth is configured with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_username>>

A password when using HTTP Basic Authentication to connect to {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_username"]
===== `auth_basic_username`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-auth_basic_password>> is also required.

A user name when using HTTP Basic Authentication to connect to {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-cloud_auth"]
===== `cloud_auth`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.

Cloud authentication string ("<username>:<password>" format) is an alternative
for the `auth_basic_username`/`auth_basic_password` pair and can be obtained from Elastic Cloud web console.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-cloud_id"]
===== `cloud_id`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-explicit}

Cloud Id, from the Elastic Cloud web console.

When connecting with a Cloud Id, communication to {es} is secured with SSL.

For more details, check out the
{logstash-ref}/connecting-to-cloud.html[Logstash-to-Cloud documentation].

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-hosts"]
===== `hosts`

* Value type is a list of <<uri,uri>>s
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Constraints:
** When any URL contains a protocol component, all URLs must have the same protocol as each other.
** `https`-protocol hosts use HTTPS and cannot be combined with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled, `+ssl_enabled => false+`>>.
** `http`-protocol hosts use unsecured HTTP and cannot be combined with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled, `+ssl_enabled => true+`>>.
** When any URL omits a port component, the default `9200` is used.
** When any URL contains a path component, all URLs must have the same path as each other.

A non-empty list of {es} hosts to connect.

Examples:

    `"127.0.0.1"`
    `["127.0.0.1:9200","127.0.0.2:9200"]`
    `["http://127.0.0.1"]`
    `["https://127.0.0.1:9200"]`
    `["https://127.0.0.1:9200/subpath"]` (If using a proxy on a subpath)

When connecting with a list of hosts, communication to {es} is secured with SSL unless configured otherwise.

[WARNING]
.Disabling SSL is dangerous
============
The security of this plugin relies on SSL to avoid leaking credentials and to avoid running illegitimate ingest pipeline definitions.

There are two ways to disable SSL:

* Provide a list of `http`-protocol hosts
* Set <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled, `+ssl_enabled => false+`>>

============

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate"]
===== `ssl_certificate`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key>> and <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key_passphrase>> are also required.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}

Path to a PEM-encoded certificate or certificate chain with which to identify this plugin to {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate_authorities"]
===== `ssl_certificate_authorities`

* Value type is a list of <<path,path>>s
* There is no default value for this setting.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}
* {prohibit-ssl-verify-none}

This setting can be used to _override_ the system trust store for verifying the SSL certificate presented by {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_enabled"]
===== `ssl_enabled`

* Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
* There is no default value for this setting.

Secure SSL communication to {es} is enabled unless:

* it is explicitly disabled with `+ssl_enabled => false+`; OR
* it is implicitly disabled by providing `http`-protocol <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-hosts>>.

Specifying `+ssl_enabled => true+` can be a helpful redundant safeguard to ensure this plugin cannot be configured to use non-ssl communication.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key"]
===== `ssl_key`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Required when connection identity is configured with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate>>
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}

A path to a PKCS8-formatted SSL certificate key.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_keystore_password"]
===== `ssl_keystore_password`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.

* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_keystore_password>> is also required.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}

A path to a JKS- or PKCS12-formatted keystore with which to identify this plugin to {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key_passphrase"]
===== `ssl_key_passphrase`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Required when connection identity is configured with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_certificate>>
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}

A password or passphrase of the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_key>>.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path"]
===== `ssl_truststore_path`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* When present, <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_password>> is required.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}
* {prohibit-ssl-verify-none}

A path to JKS- or PKCS12-formatted keystore where trusted certificates are located.

This setting can be used to _override_ the system trust store for verifying the SSL certificate presented by {es}.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_password"]
===== `ssl_truststore_password`

* Value type is <<password,password>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* Required when connection trust is configured with <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path>>
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}

Password for the <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_truststore_path>>.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ssl_verification_mode"]
===== `ssl_verification_mode`

* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
* {prohibit-ssl-disabled-effective}

Level of verification of the certificate provided by {es}.

SSL certificates presented by {es} are fully-validated by default.

* Available modes:
** `none`: performs no validation, implicitly trusting any server that this plugin connects to (insecure)
** `certificate`: validates the server-provided certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority and that the server can prove possession of its associated private key (less secure)
** `full` (default): performs the same validations as `certificate` and also verifies that the provided certificate has an identity claim matching the server we are attempting to connect to (most secure)

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-geoip_database_directory"]
===== `geoip_database_directory`

* Value type is <<path,path>>
* There is no default value for this setting.

When using the GeoIp processor, this plugin does _not_ have access to the GeoIp databases that are a part of the {es} cluster, and must be configured with locally-available database files.

Databases are registered by file name, and most integrations rely on databases being present named:

 * `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb`
 * `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`
 * `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`

This plugin will discover any regular file with the `.mmdb` suffix in the provided directory, and expects the files it finds to be in the MaxMind DB format.
