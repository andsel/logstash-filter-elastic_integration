# Elastic Integration plugin for Logstash

This is a plugin for [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash), and is not meant to be used on its own.

It can be used in a Logstash pipeline to perform the transformations that are applied by many [Elastic Integrations](https://www.elastic.co/integrations/data-integrations) _before_ sending the events to Elasticsearch.

## Documentation

Logstash provides infrastructure to automatically generate documentation for this plugin from its [asciidoc source](docs/index.asciidoc).
All plugin documentation are placed under one [central location](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/).
